Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning in Python
Project Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning in Python. The primary goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions to minimize financial losses and protect customers. The system uses Logistic Regression as the predictive model.

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets and Python-based machine learning implementations.

Features

Detects fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset.

Uses Logistic Regression for classification.

Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

Ready for use in Python, Google Colab, environments.

Dataset

Contains anonymized transactions from European cardholders in September 2013.

Features are transformed using PCA for privacy.

The target column indicates fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0) transactions.

Tech Stack

Python

Google Colab 

Libraries Used

pandas – For data manipulation

numpy – For numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn – For data visualization

scikit-learn – For machine learning modeling and evaluation

Usage

Load and explore the dataset.

Perform data preprocessing to clean and scale the data.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.

Train a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Use the model to detect potential fraudulent transactions in new data.

Project Structure

Main notebook contains the end-to-end workflow for data analysis and model building.

Dataset folder contains the credit card transactions dataset.
